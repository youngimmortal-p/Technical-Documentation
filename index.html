            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example,
            to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, 
                 or add animations and other decorative features.</p>
                 <p>This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works,
                     what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

            <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use.
                 There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, 
                 we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
                <p>This <link> element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute,
                     and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. 
                     You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. 
                    Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:</p>
                    <code>h1 {
                        color: red;
                      }</code>

        <article>
            <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. 
                It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. 
                Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage,
                 and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).</li>
                    <li>It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory.
                         The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.</li>
                    <li>The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, 
                        such as embedded images, videos, and even linked CSS!
                         JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process</li>
                    <li>The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on.
                         Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM,
                         and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).</li>

        <header>CSS Selectors</header>
        <article>
        <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell
           the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the
           CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
           The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.</p>
           <p>If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined into a selector 
            list so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors. For example,
             if I have the same CSS for an h1 and also a class of .special, I could write this as two separate rules.</p>
           <code>h1 {
            color: blue;
          }
          
          .special {
            color: blue;
          }</code>
          <p>I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.
          </p>
          <code>h1, .special {
            color: blue;
          }</code>

        <article>
          <p>The final selectors we will look at are called combinators, because they combine other selectors in a 
            way that gives them a useful relationship to each other and the location of content in the document.</p>
            <p>The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space (" ") character — combines two selectors 
              such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent,
               parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector. 
              Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Text inside an element is laid out inside the element's content box. It starts at the top left of the content
             area (or the top right, in the case of RTL language content), and flows towards the end of the line.
              Once it reaches the end, it goes down to the next line and flows to the end again.
               This pattern repeats until all the content has been placed in the box. Text content effectively behaves
                like a series of inline elements, being laid out on lines adjacent to one another, 
                and not creating line breaks until the end of the line is reached,
             or unless you force a line break manually using the <br> element.</p>
             <p>The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements, which is usually the text,
               but can also include a couple of other things,
               such as an underline or overline placed on text using the text-decoration property.
              color can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
              <code>p {
                color: red;
              }</code>

        <article>
          <p>But there is an alternative that works very well. CSS allows you to specify font files, available on the web, 
            to be downloaded along with your website as it's accessed.
             This means that any browser supporting this CSS feature can display the fonts you've specifically chosen.
              Amazing! The syntax required looks something like this:
            First of all, you have a @font-face ruleset at the start of the CSS, which specifies the font file(s) to download:
            css
            </p>
            <code>@font-face {
              font-family: "myFont";
              src: url("myFont.woff2");
            }</code>
            <p>You can use the Firefox Font Editor to investigate and manipulate the fonts in use on your page,
               whether they are web fonts or not.
